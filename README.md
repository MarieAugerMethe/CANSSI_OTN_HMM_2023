# CANSSI OTN Hidden Markov Model Workshop 2023

## Description and format

  This workshop was developed by Marie Auger-Méthé, Ron Togunov, Fanny Dupont, Natasha Klappstein and Arturo Esquivel for the 2023 CANSSI meeting. The goal of the workshop is to illustrate the application of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to movement data from marine animals to classify behaviours and identify behaviour-specific habitat associations. 
 
The tutorial will be completed together and will begin with a 30-minute introduction that will provide an overview of the tutorial objectives, and will go through the statistical background required.

## Workshop learning objectives

- Statistical framework for HMMs and their application to animal movement data
- Selecting appropriate temporal resolution for HMM analysis
- Interpolating missing locations (linear, crw, path segmentation, and multiple imputation)
- Fit HMMs to animal movement data to identify behaviours
- Incorporate covariates on state transition probability to identify conditions that promote different behaviours
- Integrating covariates on emission probabilities to model biased random walks 

## Prerequisite experience

- Intermediate R coding
- Familiarity with animal movement/telemetry data
