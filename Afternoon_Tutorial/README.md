# CANSSI OTN Hidden Markov Model: *Afternoon Tutorial*

Welcome to the afternoon tutorial! We will begin with a 20-minute introduction to accelerometer data and motivate the use of Hidden Markov models (HMMs) in marine sciences. We will then move to the tutorial to learn how to fit a basic HMM to the acceleration data of a free-ranging blacktip reef shark (Papastamatiou et al. 2015). There will be exercises at the end of the tutorial to give you a chance to practice fitting HMMs on your own. Solutions will be posted in this repository the following day.

## Workshop Learning Objectives

  - Fit a basic HMM to accelerometer data using `momentuHMM`
  - Incorporating and interpreting covariates on behaviour transition probabilities
  - Visualizing the Depth time series with decoded states
  - Use the Akaike Information Criteria for model selection
  - Practice what you've learned by working on exercises
