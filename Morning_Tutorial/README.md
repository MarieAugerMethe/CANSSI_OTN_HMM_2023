# CANSSI OTN Hidden Markov Model: *Morning Tutorial*

Hi, welcome to the morning tutorial. It will be completed together, and can be found in the [Activity](./Activity/Tutorial_Narwhal_morning_activity.Rmd) folder and will begin with a 30-minute introduction that will provide an overview of the tutorial objectives, and will go through the statistical background required. The tutorial has some guided activities.

We will look at a narwhal dataset provided by Dr. Marianne Marcoux. The narwhals have been tagged in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut, Canada. We will look at their movement over a two-week duration. Let's get started.

Below is a reminder of the structure of the tutorial and how to get it set up. 
## Workshop learning objectives

- Statistical framework for HMMs and their application to animal movement data
- Selecting appropriate temporal resolution for HMM analysis
- Interpolating missing locations (linear, crw, path segmentation, and multiple imputation)
- Fit HMMs to animal movement data to identify behaviours
- Incorporate covariates on state transition probability to identify conditions that promote different behaviours
- Integrating covariates on emission probabilities to model biased random walks 


## Preparation/instructions

- Download and unzip workshop zip from Github
- Install all the required packages as described in 0_Installing_packages.Rmd
- Make sure all packages are up-to-date as older versions may not work
- View each lecture in advance of their respective workshop date
- Create new R script in the CANSSI_OTN_HMM_2023 directory
- Follow the slides by opening [slides](./presentation_slides.pdf)
- Follow along with the tutorial [html](./Narwhal/Tutorial_Narwhal_morning.html) file.

Let's go !
